# This is a project i practice on containerziation

---

## What i used:

- Docker desktop.
- some docker command in terminal.
- created api using node and express for backend.
- created react app for the frontend.
- Used docker-compose to automate the whole operation.

---

--- 
# How to use
## To get the api image use:
```
docker pull mshalaan/myapi 
```

## To get the blog image use:
```
docker pull mshalaan/myblog
```

### To run the whole project and the 2 images in one step use docker-compose:
```
docker-compose up
```
## But you have to be in the root dir to run this command.
